# treeviewmenurefresh README

This extensions defines a custom tree view with 2 commands in its menu.
The `when` clause of each command refers to a custom context variable, comparing it to a different value.
The context variable is updated when the commands are invoked.
This makes the command buttons in the tree menu switch like a sort of toggle button.
